# libxcb-errors (with m4)

xcb-util-errors is a utility library that gives human readable names to error
codes and event codes and also to major and minor numbers.

The necessary information is drawn from xcb-proto's protocol descriptions.

This library is especially useful when working with extensions and is mostly
useful for debugging.
